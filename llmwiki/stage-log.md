# Stage log

A one-paragraph-per-stage running log. The full report for each stage lives in
[`../docs/stages/`](../docs/stages/); this file is the fast "what landed, in what
order" view.

| Stage | Landed | What it added | Report |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | 2026-10-13 | repo skeleton, `AGENTS.md`, `knowledge.md`, docs, `tools/doctor.ps1`, `versions.lock.json`, dependency matrix | [`00-report`](../docs/stages/00-report.md) |
| 01 | 2026-10-13 | `lib/` UPM package + six layer asmdefs + vendored EcsLite, the `dotnet` harness, `Shared` primitives (`IRandomSource`/`Xoshiro128`/`RandomStreams`, `IClock`, `FixedTicker`, `Result`/`Error`) | [`01-report`](../docs/stages/01-report.md) |
| 02 | 2026-10-13 | Luban 5.1.0 + protoc 33.6, `data/` (12 tables), generated C#, `IGameConfig` port + adapter, config hash, 4 gate tools, 12 broken fixtures | [`02-report`](../docs/stages/02-report.md) |
| 02b | 2026-10-14 | **Battle contract v1**: `Domain/Combat/Battle` interfaces + `BattleEventRing` + `BattleReplay`, `FakeBattleSession` in Application, `BattleSessionContractTests<TFactory>` | [`02b-report`](../docs/stages/02b-report.md) |
| 03 | 2026-10-14 | **Unity shell + first Web build + Thai text decision**: `UnityProject/` on `6000.3.9f1`/URP referencing `lib/` as a local package; Boot/Title/ThaiTextSpike scenes; 7-probe smoke suite published to the page; Playwright suite on the real WebGL build; [ADR 0008](../docs/adr/0008-thai-text-ui-stack.md) (uGUI+TMP, Static baked font assets) | [`03-report`](../docs/stages/03-report.md) |

| 04 | 2026-10-14 | **Prototype data, `data/` only**: 14 pieces (3 bags, 4 arcane weapons one per cast behaviour, 3 charms, 1 tome, 2 offerings, 1 familiar) each merging to tier 3, a real tag vocabulary behind the 5 GDD combo rules, 4 enemies + 2-phase Pob, the 5-floor run with its wave timeline, a 14-row shop pool, 51 localization rows; `item.footprint` column; the **footprint picture format** (`XX.|.XX`, parsed in Domain) per [ADR 0009](../docs/adr/0009-footprint-picture-format.md); rules for item footprint / unknown tag / incomplete merge ladder / unreachable piece / wave spawn window; fixtures 12 → 17 | [`04-report`](../docs/stages/04-report.md) |

## Notes carried forward

- Stage 02b is an insertion between the original Stage 02 and Stage 03. It does
  not change `data/` and does not open Unity.
- No gameplay rule (combo, shop, combat) exists yet; the battle *contract* does.
- Determinism is guaranteed within one runtime only (see the scope gotcha).
- `lib/` is now compiled twice: by `dotnet` (lib/Tests~) and by Unity as the local
  package `com.projectsurvive.core`. A change to a rule-engine file must keep both
  green; `Assets/csc.rsp` exists only to keep the Unity compile quiet about the
  nullable annotations the `dotnet` build already enables.
- **Stage 04 is data only.** No rule, system or scene was added; `lib/` changed only in
  `Domain/Config` (the footprint parser and `ItemConfig.Footprint`), the Infrastructure
  adapter, the validator and tests. `data/` is now the canonical description of the
  prototype's content, so a balance change is a CSV edit, a regeneration and a diff.
- **Item-local effects are still unmodelled** (charm passive size, offering heal/bia
  and uses) — [ADR 0010](../docs/adr/0010-item-local-effects-deferred.md). The numbers
  must land in `data/` with their consumer, never in code.
- Nothing verifies behavior in a *player* except the browser test. Two Stage 03 bugs
  (stripped DI constructors, emptied font tables) were invisible to Mono-based
  EditMode/PlayMode tests and only the real build caught them — `tests/web/` is the
  gate for anything IL2CPP-, AOT- or asset-serialization-sensitive.
